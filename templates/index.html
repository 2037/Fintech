        <p>This project aims to predict the risk of loan given personal credit history, which is refered as a secondary
            credit model populated among the P2P loan investors. </p>
        <p>The traditional credit model, which requires complicated mathematical algorithms and a complete credit
            history to rate one&#39;s credit score. Alternately, Secondary Credit Models are able to capture the
            investment oppoturnity without external efforts of extracting insight from credit history in order to get
            higher return with less risk in a short time. </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Some of the biggest investors at Lending Club and Prosper filter the available loans using a secondary
                credit model, which allows them to instantly calculate the likely ROI of each available loan,
                identifying where there is an opportunity to earn above average returns. (<a

        Buying zones covering the high return and low risk cases as credit models missed the chances...<br><br>
        <p>This web app used the following methodology: Train by batch, predict on the fly, serve via REST API, as the
            training and persisting are done offline while prediction is done in real-time. The XGBoost model is trained
            offline and deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This web is used on Flask as web framework. </p>
        <h2 id="data-description-and-process">Data description and process</h2>
        <p>From data downloaded from Lending Club, we intersected history and current data to get useful and valid
            features. After loading lending club API of the year 2017 (443k) and selecting loans that are 36 months,
            fully paid and charged off, 257k records with 108 features were transformed into 124 columns of features by
            feature engineering, which involved column dropping, datetime transformation, one-hot Encoding, frequency
            encoding(zip codes), ordinal feature encoding (grades and subgrades) and etc. The whole set (257k) of data
            were split into training set (206k) and test set(51k). Training set was again split into training set and
            validation set by 70%/30% in order to use early stopping to find the optimal number of boosting rounds.</p>
        <p>Binary logistic regression is set to be objective function as we only predict two results, and as we predict
            the probability of default we will set a threshold to predict whether the application for loan is dangerous
            or safe. The tree booster parameters are set as following in xgb.train():</p>

        <h2 id="what-is-xgboost-">What is XGBoost?</h2>
        <p>XGBoost is an open-source machine-learning project developed by Tianqi Chen and Carlos Guestrin. It
            efficiently implements the GBDT algorithm and makes many improvements in algorithm and engineering. It is
            widely used in Kaggle competitions and many other machine learning competitions and has achieved good
            results.</p>
        <p>XGBoost is essentially a GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) that strives to maximize speed and
            efficiency, so it is called X (Extreme) GBoosted. Including the aforementioned, both are boosting methods.
            In addition to some differences in algorithm from traditional GBDT, XGBoost has also done a lot of
            optimization in engineering implementation. </p>

        <h2 id="where-is-the-advantage-of-xgboost-">What is the advantage of XGBoost?</h2>
        <p>XGBoost uses Taylor expansion to get first-order and second-order partial derivatives, which contributes
            faster and more accurate gradient descendence. Using Taylor expansion to obtain the second-order derivative
            form of the function as the independent variable can be used without selecting the specific form of the loss
            function. Leaf splitting optimization can be performed only by relying on the value of the input data, which
            essentially separates the selection of the loss function from the optimization of the model
            algorithm/parameter selection. This decoupling increases the applicability of XGBoost, making it possible to
            select on-demand loss functions for either classification or regression.</p>

        <h2 id="how-is-xgboost-different-from-gbdt-">How is XGBoost different from GBDT?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>GBDT is a machine learning algorithm and XGBoost is an engineering implementation of this algorithm.
            </li>
            <li>When using CART as the base classifier, XGBoost explicitly adds a regular term to control the complexity
                of the model, which is beneficial to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the
                model.</li>
            <li>GBDT only uses the first-order derivative information of the cost function during model training.
                XGBoost performs second-order Taylor expansion on the cost function and can use both the first-order and
                second-order derivatives at the same time.</li>
            <li>Traditional GBDT uses CART as the base classifier, and XGBoost supports multiple types of base
                classifiers, such as linear classifiers.</li>
            <li>Traditional GBDT uses all the data in each iteration, XGBoost adopts a strategy similar to Random
                Forest, which supports the sampling of data.</li>
            <li>The traditional GBDT is not designed to deal with missing values, XGBoost can automatically learn the
                missing value processing strategy.</li>
        </ul>
